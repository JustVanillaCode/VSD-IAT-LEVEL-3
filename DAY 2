 It was hard for the general public and masses to access the PDK but now Google and Skywater technology have worked out an agreement for a 130-nanometer production pdk which was on June / 30 / 2020 the license  is Apache 2.0. This was the first ever open-source pdk for the Masses. So now we have all the elements for the open-source digital ASIC design for EDL tools: qflow, OpenRoad, and OpenLane. For RTL designs we have librecores, opencores, Github, and finally for PDK we have the agreement of Google and Skywater for the 130-nanometer production PDK.

  The market share for different types of cutting edge techonology is as follows -

However, the market share for 130 nanometers is about 6%, and the  cutting-edge technology right now is about five nanometers. The 6% is about equivalent to $4.5 billion in annual revenue this is mainly due to two reasons because several applications do not need the advanced nodes. The fabrication process for these 130 and 180 nanometers is cheaper than compared to the advanced nodes. The Intel P4EE ran at 3.4 gigahertz and was designed by Intel using the 130-nanometer technology also the OSU team reported that a 327 megahertz post layout clock frequency for a single cycle rv 32 icp was received from a 130-nanometer node. 
The simplified RTL to GDSII to flow starts from the RTL which has the synthesis to floor planning to placement then the PDK which has the clock tree synthesis then the routing then finally the GDSII which is the end of the flow. The synthesis is as follows synthesis converts the rtl to a circuit out of components from the standard cell library (S C L) also known as the gate level synthesis. "Standard" cells have a regular layout, each has a different view or model like electrical, HDL, or spice. Layout ( abstract or detailed). The idea for Floor and power planning Is basically about the area of the silicon chip, die, etc, and the power distribution. Cheap floor planning the partition of the chip dye between different system building blocks takes place and also the placement of IO pads is done in this process. In macro floor planning the pin location, rows definition, dimensions, etc are done/planned. Power pads, power straps, and power rings are constructed in power planning. a gym is powered through many veedy deals and power pads They are constructed parallelly such parallel constructions are there to reduce the resistance and also to address the electromagnetization problem. The power distribution uses the upper metal layers rather than the lower metal layers as the upper metal layers as they are thicker than the lower metal layers and, hence have less resistance. Typically self placement is usually done in two steps global and detailed. In the clock three synthesis we create a clock distribution network to deliver the clock to all sequential elements within minimum skew 0 is hard to achieve and also make it in a good shape usually like a tree shape like a H, X... . Routing implements the nets using interconnection  available from the placed and available metal layers. The Skywater P D K has six layers the lowest one Is the interconnect layer And the titanium matride layer. The rest five layers are toggled into interconnecting layers Or aluminum layers. Enrouting metal tracks for a routing grid The routing grid is huge a divide and conquer approach is used, global routing creates routing guides and detailed routing uses the routing guides to implement the actual wiring. This includes physical verification like design rule checking D R C layout versus schematic l V S and timing verification like S T A or static timing analysis. Since the release of the PDK eFabless has decided to create an open-source asic flow called OpenLane. OpenLane started as an open source flow for a true open source tape out experiment striVe is a family of open everything SoCs like open pdk, open eda, and open rtl. The striVe family has many members they are the original striVe by SkyWater then striVe2 by Google, striVe3 by OpenRoad, striVe5 by efabless then finally the striVe6. The main goal for open lane is to produce clean gds 2 with no human intervention which means no human in the loop. And that too without any violation of LVS, DRC, and Timing Violation.    OpenLane is tuned for 130 nm open PDK. It also supports AFAB180 and GF130g.  It is also containized which means it is functional out of the box. It can be used to harden Macros and Chips. it has two modes of operation autonomous and interactive.
